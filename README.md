In this project, I have covered the following topics:
  Creation of restful web services i.e http methods GET, POST, PUT $ DELETE.
  Java Persistence Api(JPA) i.e entity relational mapping
  Working with project Lombok to avoid boiler-plate code i.e getters and setters, constructors
  Exception handling. Well handled messages incase of a code break
  Working with 2 relational databases i.e Postgres & MySql
  Unit Testing(Mockito) on service and repository layers and also the controllers
  Deploying the app using different profiles. In this case I have used 3 profiles
  Worked with both application properties file and also application yaml file. Both comfortable worked with.
  Worked with Logger, Actuators
  
  BY DEFAULT THE APP IS RUNNING ON PORT 8001 on yaml file but on port 8000 on properties file.
